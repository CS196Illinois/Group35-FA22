Dear faculty & staff,
This week the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD) is hosting Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine booster clinics on Tuesday and Wednesday for healthcare workers and first responders.
Eligibility
You must be fully vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine only.
You must be a healthcare worker (this also includes COVID-19 testing center and lab employees) OR you must be a first responder (this includes law enforcement, fire services, emergency medical services, etc.).
Appointments
There will be only walk-in appointments.
Appointments will take place this Tuesday, Sept. 28 and Wednesday, Sept. 29 from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. each day.
Location
1900 S. 1st Street, Champaign(east wing of the iHotel and Conference Center)
CUPHD is leading vaccination distribution for employees in our county. If you are not eligible for a booster in this round, please be patient. As we learn more information about next steps, we will update the campus community as soon as we are able. Champaign County residents with questions should contact CUPHD by email at coronavirus@c-uphd.org.
At this time, the university does not plan to require booster shots, but we strongly encourage everyone to get them when they are eligible. Employees may receive a booster shot during work hours without the use of accrued vacation or sick leave.
Thank you for your understanding as we work to continue to maximize safety for our entire community.
Sincerely,
Robert. J. JonesChancellor
