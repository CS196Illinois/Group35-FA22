Fall 2021 student fees
March 26, 2021 2:02 PM
Dear students, faculty and staff,
This message is to make you aware of the plan for student fee assessment for Fall 2021. In Fall 2020 and Spring 2021, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, fee assessment was changed each semester in recognition of the reduced in-person services and course offerings.
In anticipation of a semester that will more closely resemble pre-pandemic conditions, Fall 2021 fees will return to standard assessment for students in campus-based programs. Fee assessment for fully online programs has been and remains unchanged.
More information about the Fall 2021 fee schedule can be found on the Office of the Registrar’s website:
Undergraduate
Graduate and Professional
We hope this notice will help students and their families in planning for costs of the upcoming Fall semester.
Sincerely,
Andreas C. CangellarisVice Chancellor for Academic Affairs & Provost
Danita M. B. YoungVice Chancellor for Student Affairs
