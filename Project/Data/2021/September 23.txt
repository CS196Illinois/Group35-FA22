IDPH Vaccination Clinics
September 23, 2021 2:03 PM
Dear Colleagues,
As you are aware, the university is requiring all faculty and staff to be fully vaccinated for COVID-19. To help our employees meet this requirement, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) are conducting two (2) on-campus COVID-19 vaccination clinics that are open to all employees next Tuesday, Sept. 28. Employees do not need to utilize benefit time to visit these clinics and receive a vaccination.
IDPH Vaccination ClinicStudent Dining and Residential Programs Building (SDRP)301 East Gregory Drive, Champaign11 a.m. to 8 p.m.
IDPH Vaccination ClinicFacilities and Services1501 South Oak Street, Champaign7 a.m. to 4 p.m.
It is anticipated that both Johnson and Johnson and Pfizer vaccines will be available. At the time of the first dose, a follow up appointment for the second dose will be given. Those follow up appointments will be scheduled for October 19, 2021.
All faculty and staff who are not able to receive the vaccine for medical or religious reasons must request an exemption through the ADA Division of the Office for Access and Equity by filling out the request form and submitting any relevant documentation: ADA Division Online Employee Accommodation Request Form.
We are hopeful these on-campus clinics will allow for more convenient access to the vaccines. Thank you for doing your part to maximize the safety of our entire community. If you have questions, please contact ihr-ler@illinois.edu.
Sincerely,
Deb StoneInterim Senior Associate Chancellor for Human Resources
