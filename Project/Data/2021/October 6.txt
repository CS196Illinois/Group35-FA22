Restricting technology access for undergraduate testing noncompliance
October 6, 2021 10:02 AM
Dear Faculty, Staff & Graduate Students,
Starting on Wednesday, Oct. 13, the university will begin restricting access to certain technologies (including Canvas, Compass, Kaltura and others) for undergraduate students who are out of COVID-19 testing compliance. See the full list here. Tomorrow, I plan to send this email message to all undergraduate students explaining this new process.
I wanted you to be aware of this additional layer of compliance that is designed to maximize the safety of our university community. Thank you for your continued patience and partnership as we navigate the COVID-19 pandemic together.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor
