November 3, 2021 1:45 PM
Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,
The Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD) has announced that children ages 5-11 are now eligible to receive a COVID-19 Pfizer vaccine. This week, both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended vaccination for children 5-11. According to CUPHD, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is administered as a two-dose primary series, 3 weeks apart, but is a lower dose (10 micrograms) than that used for individuals 12 years of age and older (30 micrograms). At this time, vaccinations for this age group are by appointment only. Read the full press release from CUPHD here.
