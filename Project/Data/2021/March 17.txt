COVID-19 Emergency Grants for Graduate Students
March 17, 2021 1:58 PM
Dear graduate students,
The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign will soon launch a second COVID-19 emergency grant program for graduate students.
The program is funded in large part by the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF) II, which is part of the Federal Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act (CRRSAA), 2021.
These grants are dedicated to helping graduate students who demonstrate exceptional need. Grants can be used toward the cost of education and other emergency costs that have arisen due to the coronavirus, such as tuition, food, housing, health care (including mental health care) or child care.
Grants for graduate students will be available in amounts between $500 and $1,000.
Degree-seeking students enrolled in any graduate program (including professional programs) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign are eligible to apply, regardless of nationality or citizenship status. Students must be registered during the Spring 2021 semester to qualify.
An application process for graduate students will be announced soon and will be available on The Graduate College website.
Sincerely,
Wojtek Chodzko-ZajkoDean, Graduate College
