Area Pharmacies
Please continue to check the websites of local pharmacies for available appointments.
Area pharmacies may add new appointment slots throughout the week, so continue to check their websites frequently.
You can use https://vaccinefinder.org/ to look for available appointments nearby.
We encourage members of the university community to be vaccinated if and when they are able to do so. We also acknowledge that some individuals have health conditions or other reasons why they cannot be vaccinated. See here for more guidance about vaccination status.
If you are not able to make an appointment in this round, please be patient as vaccine supply is still somewhat limited. We will send another message when CUPHD has more vaccine appointments available. As a reminder, the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District is leading vaccination distribution for our county. The university shares information from CUPHD when it is relevant to faculty, staff or students. The university does not control the vaccine appointments, timelines or community clinic locations.
The distribution of a vaccine is welcome news, but we must continue to be as diligent as ever in safety precautions, including regular COVID-19 testing, wearing face coverings, social distancing, hand washing and avoiding large gatherings.
Thank you in advance for your understanding as we work through this next phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and rely on the guidance of our public health leaders to make the best decisions for our community.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor
