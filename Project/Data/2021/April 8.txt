Dear students,
The Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD) has announced that all individuals 16 years of age or older who live or work in Champaign County are now eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.

Please note mandatory testing requirements are still in place for individuals who are fully vaccinated.

You can use https://vaccinefinder.org/ to look for available appointments nearby.
We will send another message when CUPHD has more vaccine appointments available. As a reminder, the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District is leading vaccination distribution for our county. The university shares information from CUPHD when it is relevant to faculty, staff or students. The university does not control the vaccine appointments, timelines or community clinic locations.
The distribution of a vaccine is welcome news, but we must continue to be as diligent as ever in safety precautions, including regular COVID-19 testing, wearing face coverings, social distancing, hand washing and avoiding large gatherings. Mandatory testing requirements are still in place for individuals who are fully vaccinated.
Thank you in advance for your understanding as we work through this next phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and rely on the guidance of our public health leaders to make the best decisions for our community.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor
