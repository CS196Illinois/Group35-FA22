COVID-19 Testing Exemption Process
January 15, 2021 10:16 AM
All Undergraduate and Graduate Students: ­­­­
All students living on-campus or residing in Champaign, Urbana, or Savoy are required to test even if they are taking a fully online schedule. In addition, the university’s COVID-19 testing policy requires all students working on-campus, attending in-person classes, or participating in any on-campus activities to participate in the on-campus testing program.
The university has developed a process for students who are living locally (Urbana, Champaign, and Savoy) and who are not coming to campus during the spring 2021 semester to apply for an exemption from the COVID-19 testing requirement. Exemptions will be granted rarely and only to students who can demonstrate that participating in the testing program is especially burdensome to them.
Effective Friday, January 15, students who wish to apply for an exemption should submit their information at go.illinois.edu/CovidExemption.
Only students who are living locally and NOT coming to campus are eligible to request an exemption.
Students who were granted an exemption from testing in the fall 2020 semester will need to reapply for a spring 2021 exemption at go.illinois.edu/CovidExemption.
Thank you,
Dr. Danita M. B. YoungVice Chancellor for Student Affairs
