Fall 2021 instruction and registration
March 4, 2021 11:12 AM
Dear students,
I write to make you aware that planning for the Fall 2021 semester instruction is well underway. In addition to the success of our ongoing COVID-19 mitigation strategies, we are also encouraged by the success and growing availability of COVID-19 vaccines.
For the Fall semester, we are confident that we will be able to offer considerably more in-person instruction for our students than has been available during the current academic year.
Of course, the university will continue to follow guidance from the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD), the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as it evolves. We anticipate that existing COVID-19 mitigation strategies–face coverings, regular testing, contact tracing–will continue to be in effect during the fall semester.
Departments and colleges are currently developing the Fall 2021 class schedule. We expect the schedule to be available to view on Monday, April 5. Registration for continuing students for the Fall 2021 semester will begin on Monday, April 19.
Sincerely,
Andreas C. CangellarisVice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost
