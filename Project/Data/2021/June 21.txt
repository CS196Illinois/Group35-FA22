Student COVID-19 Vaccination Expectations for the Fall 2021 Semester
June 21, 2021 12:02 PM
Dear faculty and staff,
As you may have read in this message from President Tim Killeen, the University of Illinois System is moving into this next phase of the pandemic with a requirement that students at all three campuses (Urbana-Champaign, Chicago and Springfield) receive a complete course of COVID-19 vaccines before the beginning of the Fall 2021 semester if they are able to do so.
We will be providing you soon with additional information and details about our plan toward this goal. At this time, I am sending this massmail to students to share the principles that will guide the fall semester at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I hope you will also read it, so you are aware of the expectations that will be in place for the Fall 2021 semester.
At this time, there are no plans to require the COVID-19 vaccine for faculty and staff. However, faculty and staff who are not vaccinated will have to continue to wear face coverings and participate in the COVID-19 testing program.
Again, we are still working through many details, and we hope to share more specifics soon. Thank you for your continued patience and understanding as we navigate this next phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor
