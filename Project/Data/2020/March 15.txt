Dear Students, Faculty and Staff,
As of 2:30 p.m. Sunday, March 15, 2020, Champaign-Urbana Public Health District (CUPHD) has announced there is a confirmed case of the COVID-19 disease in Champaign County. The individual is not a student, staff or faculty member. CUPHD has traced the recent activities of the individual and does not believe there is any link to being in a university facility or attending a university event. The individual is in self-quarantine under the supervision of CUPHD and those who may have been exposed have been contacted.
CUPHD will be holding a public news conference today at 3 p.m. that will be live-streamed from the district’s Facebook page and they anticipate local broadcast outlets will also carry the event.
CUPHD tells us the risk of transmission for the general community is considered to be low from this case. However, they have also said there are at least 50 additional tests pending and they expect to see more cases confirmed in the coming days.
If we learn of new information about the outbreak that would have more direct impact on our students, faculty, staff or operations, we will share this as soon as we can. Please continue to check covid19.illinois.edu regularly for current information and resources.
Thank you for your patience and your efforts to keep one another safe during this difficult time.
