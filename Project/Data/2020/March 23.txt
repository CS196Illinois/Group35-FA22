Illinois Massmail
Effective immediately, there will be a very limited number of campus mail deliveries. With most of the campus buildings locked, departments will not be generating letters and parcels to deliver to other campus locations. A few offices have made special arrangements for critical items to be delivered. If you or your department has a critical need for transportation of campus mail or processing of outgoing US Mail, please contact Campus Mail at printing@illinois.edu and we will make arrangements. Outgoing mail that needs to be metered requires a pink barcode sticker or a CFOAPAL to which the postage can be charged.
While the campus is following Governor Pritzker’s order to stay at home, please do not put campus mail that you need delivered in any campus mailboxes except the one outside the Turner Student Services Building located at 610 E John St, Champaign. We will be checking this box on Tuesdays and Thursdays and delivering only to buildings that are open.
As a reminder, Campus Mail handles only intracampus mail and outgoing US mail that needs to be metered. The United States Postal Service (USPS) handles all incoming and stamped outgoing US mail. For US mail, the United States Postal Service (USPS) carriers will deliver mail to offices that are accessible. If you wish to forward or stop your US mail, you will need to contact USPS at 800-275-8777 or usps.com.
Campus Mail does not control deliveries that are made by commercial shippers. If you are expecting deliveries from or need to ship items with UPS, FedEx, or other commercial carriers, you should contact them directly to make arrangements; UPS can be contacted through ups.com and FedEx can be contacted through fedex.com.
Take good care,
