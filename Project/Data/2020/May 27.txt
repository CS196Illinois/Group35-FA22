FREE COVID-19 antigen testing available for university employees and their families
May 27, 2020 11:40 AM
Dear Colleagues,
In preparation for the state’s move to Phase III of the governor’s plan for re-opening, we are encouraging all University employees to take advantage of the free testing offered from 8:00 a.m. - 4:00 p.m. seven days a week in the east parking lot of Market Place Shopping Center at 2000 N. Neil Street in Champaign. Enter through the south mall entrance off of Market Street. University employees and members of their households qualify for the free testing. Bring a photo ID card (children do not need IDs) and your health insurance card (but your insurance will NOT be billed).
The test is self-administered, quick and painless with a 10-15 second swab inside of each nostril. Results are available within a few days and often within a few hours.
Sincerely,
Mike DeLorenzoSenior Associate Chancellor for Administration and OperationsCo-chair, COVID-19:  Executive Steering Committee on Return to On-Campus Operations
