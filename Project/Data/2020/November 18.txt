Supporting You and Our Students During Stressful Times
November 18, 2020 8:34 AM
Dear Colleagues,
We know this semester and year have been especially challenging for you and our students as we cope with the COVID-19 pandemic and we would like to share some resources for support.
For our students, this semester has been more stressful than usual. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused feelings of stress and isolation. Added to the usual tensions of personal and family stress, the end of the semester can amplify stress as final examinations and deadlines for projects and papers approach.
Students in your classes or laboratories who show signs of panic, depression, anxiety, excessive fatigue, avoidance, confusion or who report conditions such as their "mind goes blank," may need your help and encouragement in seeking assistance.
If you become concerned about a student, the Student Assistance Center (SAC) can help. Staff in the SAC is available Monday - Friday from 8:30 a.m. – 5:00 p.m. Additionally, the Emergency Dean Program provides a University administrator who is on-call to assist in emergency situations that occur after business hours. To reach the SAC or the Emergency Dean, please call 217-333-0050. You can find additional information about these programs or refer a student for assistance by visiting odos.illinois.edu/community-of-care.
If it is a true safety emergency, please call 911.
Listed below are some of the specialized programs and services offered to support students:
