Dear Members of the University Community,
You probably have heard news reports about the coronavirus, which was first diagnosed in China and has since spread to the United States. Please know that the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is taking safety precautions to detect and treat any potential case of the virus, following the latest guidelines from Public Health.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest the following ways to protect yourself:
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Avoid close contact with people who are sick (i.e. within 6 feet).
If you are a student, and you experience symptoms such as fever, cough, and shortness of breath, or if you feel you may be at risk for coronavirus, please call McKinley Health Center immediately at (217) 333-2700. Others should contact their health care provider directly.
Thank you for taking precautions to protect yourselves and others in our community. We at McKinley Health Center wish everyone a safe and healthy semester.
Sincerely,
Robert Parker, FACP, MBA, MDDirector, McKinley Health Center
