Wellness Support Associates will be checking building access status at the entrances. These spaces will be arranged for social distancing, and, of course, face coverings will continue to be required in university facilities. Please disinfect your study area when you leave. Furniture may not be moved in the rooms.
We hope these spaces provide our students with a safe and quiet place to continue to study on campus. If you have any questions, please contact registrar@illinois.edu.
Sincerely,
