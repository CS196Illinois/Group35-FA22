Fall 2020 Class Schedule Update
July 31, 2020 8:09 AM
Dear Students,
Thanks to the hard work of units across campus and to your patience and cooperation, we are pleased to share that the Fall 2020 Class Schedule is now live in Course Explorer.
We encourage you to review your fall class schedule now and to continue to do so regularly, as minor modifications can be expected until the start of classes. When you check your updated fall schedule, you should expect to see that some of your courses have moved online or to hybrid delivery. You may also see some location changes for courses that will continue to meet in person. If you are comfortable with your schedule, there is no need to act. When considering changes, please be aware that access to in-person courses is limited. If you need to make changes, you may do so beginning with the date and time of your revised Fall 2020 Time Ticket. Information on the time ticket process, including approximate start dates assigned by group, can be found on the Office of the Registrar’s website.
Again, it is important to continue to check your schedule periodically throughout the month of August since minor modifications may still be made. Continue to carefully read any messages from your academic advisor, departmental, and/or college offices, and please connect with your advisor regarding any questions you have about your fall schedule.
Thanks again for your continued flexibility and understanding.
Sincerely,
Meghan HazenRegistrar
