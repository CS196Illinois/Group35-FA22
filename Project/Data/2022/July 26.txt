Fall 2022 COVID-19 guidelines

Dear students, faculty and staff:
As we prepare to return to our universities this fall, University of Illinois System leaders continue to think first and foremost about the safety of all of you and the surrounding communities amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
Throughout the pandemic, measures we have taken to mitigate against the virus that causes COVID-19 have made our three universities among the safest places to be. These measures – particularly vaccination – remain our best protection.
In keeping with this approach, students, faculty and staff will be required to be vaccinated against the virus, and we strongly recommend that you get booster shots, as well. Those who are not vaccinated will need to test on their campuses once a week.
Decisions about masking and any other additional requirements will be made by each university based on local conditions and requirements in their communities. Look for further guidance from your university.
Through your efforts, the U of I System has set the highest possible standard for safety during the pandemic and served as a model for the nation. We have done this while continuing to offer world-class educational opportunities to more and more students and pursuing the kind of research and innovation that changes lives for the better.
We will, as we have throughout the pandemic, adapt as necessary should conditions change.
Thank you all for your continued diligence in the academic year ahead.
Tim
