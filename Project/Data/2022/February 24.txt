COVID-19 Spring Break return guidelines
February 24, 2022 4:02 PM
Dear Faculty, Staff and Graduate Students,
In a few minutes, I plan to send this email which outlines Spring Break return information for undergraduate students:
Spring Break return
During the week after Spring Break, all undergraduate students must receive one negative on-campus test result.
They may receive this negative result between Thursday, March 17 and Friday, March 25.
They will continue to have “Granted” access until the end of the day on Friday, March 25 to give them time to meet this requirement.
In-person classes will continue as planned starting March 21.
As a reminder, face coverings will still be required in classrooms during in-person class time.
As you know, travel increases the risk of COVID-19 transmission. If you are planning to travel during Spring Break, I also encourage you to take an on-campus test as soon as you return to the community.
Thank you for your patience and understanding as we continue to make the best decisions for our entire community.
Sincerely,
Robert J. JonesChancellor
